## Flow

1. Write a failing test
2. Make the error change / make it pass
3. Refactor

Or, said another way...

1. Red
2. Green
3. Refactor

## General notes

- Start by writing the expectation first
- Need fast feedback loop
- Write just enough to change error
- Make sure you see it fail

## Plan 

1. Detect names
2. Ignore case 
3. Move text to instance data after private extraction is painful
4. Raise if company names not provided
